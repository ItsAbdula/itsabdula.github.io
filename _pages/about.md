I'm Woohyung Choi (최우형, 崔宇亨), a Ph.D student at Computer Systems Laboratory [(CSL)](https://csl.korea.ac.kr), Korea University.

My current research is focused on LLM Serving Systems. I am broadly interested in computer systems, especially those that support modern AI workloads.

I received my master's degreee in Artificial Intelligence from Ajou University under the supervision of Prof. [Jeongseob Ahn](http://jeongseob.github.io/). I also hold a B.E. degree from a Digital Media from Ajou University.
